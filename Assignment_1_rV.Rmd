## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
# A1

a <- 2
b <- 5

# A2

r1 <- sum(a,b)
r1

r2 <- sum(a,-b)
r2

r3 <- prod(a,b)
r3

r4 <- a/b
r4

# A3

v1 <- c(r1, r2, r3, r4)
v1

# A4 

r5 <- a^b # Ich bin davon ausgegangen, "a by the power of b" bedeutet a hoch b, also 2 hoch 5 = 32
v1 <- c(r1,r2,r3,r4,r5)

# A5

v1 

# A6

v2 <- c("Sum", "Difference", "Product", "Quotient", "Power sum")

# A7 

v2

# A8

df <- data.frame(v1, v2)
df

# A9

colnames(df) <- c("Results", "Operation")

# A10

df

# A11

df[3,1]


```

## Including Plots

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
